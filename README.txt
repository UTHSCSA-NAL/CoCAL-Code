## MATLAB code for CoCAL: Collaborative Clustering based on Adaptive Laplace modeling


## To perform CoCAL, please unzip nmfv1_4.rar and update input-related parameters before running cocal.m. 
   

## To set up the experiments from scratch, run the following scripts:
	cluster_no_cocal.m: Identify the optimal number of clusters in terms of adjusted Rand Index;
	cocal_noise_est.m: Estimate the noise level in the data;
	cocal_coe.m: Form empirical distributions of the coefficients;
	cocal.m: Perform clustering.
